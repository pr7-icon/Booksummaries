            Atomic Habits dives into this idea that it's not about setting huge goals; it's about having the right systems in place to make those goals happen. 
            It breaks down the science behind habits in such a simple way that you'll find yourself nodding along. The idea is that our habits are essentially a result of our systems, not just our willpower. So, it's not about aiming high; it's about tweaking your daily routine to create better habits. This book is loaded with practical strategies. From making time for new habits to designing your environment for success, 
            it's a toolkit for anyone looking to transform their habits.

            Highlight from the book: <br/> “It’s easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis”

"Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones" by James Clear explores the profound impact of small, incremental changes in behavior
 on achieving significant personal and professional growth. Clear introduces the concept of "atomic habits," which are tiny, routine behaviors that compound over time to produce remarkable results.
<div>
    <li>Small changes can lead to remarkable results over time. The concept of 1% improvement daily compounds significantly over a year.</li>

<li>Make it Obvious: Design your environment to make the cues of good habits obvious.</li>
  <li>  Make it Attractive: Pair habits with something you enjoy to make them more appealing.</li>
    <li>    Make it Easy: Reduce the friction to perform the habit by starting small.</li>
    <li>  Make it Satisfying: Use immediate rewards to reinforce positive behavior.</li>
    <li> Start new habits with an action that takes two minutes or less. This lowers the barrier to entry and helps build consistency.
    </li>
