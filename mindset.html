        <p>This reshapes how we think about success and achievement. Dweck's idea is simple yet mind-blowing: it's all about mindset.
             She breaks it down into two types: fixed mindset and growth mindset. 
            Those with a fixed mindset believe abilities are set in stone, while those with a growth mindset think skills can be developed.</p>

        <p>What's cool about this edition is how Dweck expands on the concept. She dives deeper into what she calls the false growth mindset and explores how this mindset applies not just to individuals but also to groups and organisations. 
            It's a game-changer for anyone—parents, teachers, leaders—who want to empower those around them.

        <p>Highlight from the book: “The other thing exceptional people seem to have is a special talent for converting life’s setbacks into future successes.” </p>
        <li>Dweck introduces the concept of two mindsets: fixed and growth. A fixed mindset believes intelligence and abilities are static, while a growth mindset sees them as qualities that can be developed through dedication and effort.</li>
        <li>Individuals with a growth mindset tend to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and see effort as a path to mastery. This mindset fosters resilience and a love of learning.</li>
        <li>Dweck discusses strategies for developing a growth mindset, such as reframing challenges as opportunities for growth, embracing criticism as constructive feedback, and celebrating effort and progress.</li>
        <li>Mindset affects relationships as well. A growth mindset encourages collaboration, openness to feedback, and resilience in navigating conflicts, fostering healthier interpersonal dynamics.</li>
        <li>Dweck provides practical examples and case studies throughout the book to illustrate how individuals, organizations, and educators have applied mindset principles to achieve success and personal growth.</li>
