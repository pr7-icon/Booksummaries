        <p>This reshapes how we think about success and achievement. Dweck's idea is simple yet mind-blowing: it's all about mindset.
             She breaks it down into two types: fixed mindset and growth mindset. 
            Those with a fixed mindset believe abilities are set in stone, while those with a growth mindset think skills can be developed.</p>

        <p>What's cool about this edition is how Dweck expands on the concept. She dives deeper into what she calls the false growth mindset and explores how this mindset applies not just to individuals but also to groups and organisations. 
            It's a game-changer for anyone—parents, teachers, leaders—who want to empower those around them.
