            Four Thousand Weeks is a bit different from your typical time management read but in a good way. Instead of doling out quick fixes or productivity hacks, it delves into a philosophical journey that might make you rethink your approach to life.

            Oliver Burkeman hits you with two uncomfortable truths: first, the limited time we have on this Earth means we'll never tick off every item on our to-do list. Second, even if we did, it might not make a lasting difference because, at the end of the day, death is inevitable. Sounds a bit heavy, right? But strangely liberating. 
            It's all about finding joy in the present rather than chasing endless accomplishments that might not matter in the grand scheme.

            Overall, this book's not for everyone, especially those clinging to the belief that perfect time management will solve everything. 
            But for those willing to embrace the idea of cherishing what truly matters in life—those intrinsic, joyful pursuits—this is the book for you.
        </p>

            Highlight from the book: “There’s one huge drawback in giving so little thought to the abstract idea of time, though, which uis that it severely limits what you can accomplish.”
